# Financial Machine Learning Library

Applying machine learning and statistical methods to financial and markets data is deceptively difficult.
Both classical and modern ML models and testing methods in their original form, although having been applied
successfully in many fields, typically doesn't work on financial data.

This library attempts to collect a set of machine learning and statistical methods, inspired from the latest financial
academic researches and practical industry experiences, that are modified and designed specially for handling
financial and markets microstructure data. These tools are essential for either financial machine learning researchers,
investment portfolio managers or quantitative trading practitioners.

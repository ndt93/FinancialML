# Financial Machine Learning Library

Applying machine learning and statistical methods to financial and markets data is deceptively difficult.
Both classical and modern ML models and testing methods in their original form, although having been applied
successfully in many fields, typically don't work on financial data.

This library implements a selected set of machine learning and statistical data structures and methods,
motivated by the latest financial academic researches and practical industry experiences, that are modified and designed
specially for handling financial and markets microstructure data. These tools are essential for either financial machine
learning researchers, investment portfolio managers or quantitative trading practitioners.
